# A voice-activated teleprompter

**development in progress**

This is a voice-activated teleprompter using the WebSpeech API which is currently only available
on Google Chrome. Similar teleprompters are available online, but none of them had the possibility
to switch to a language other than English.

The current version seems to work reliably now. The prompter was tested in English, German, and
French. The available languages are all those which can be selected in
[Google's WebSpeech API Demonstration](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html).
I do, however, have no idea whether word matching will work in all of these languages (in particular
those without latin alphabet).

Try the teleprompter now at [m-ff-m.github.io/teleprompter](https://m-ff-m.github.io/teleprompter/).
