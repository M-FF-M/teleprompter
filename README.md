# A voice-activated teleprompter

**development in progress**

This is a voice-activated teleprompter using the WebSpeech API which is currently only available
on Google Chrome. Similar teleprompters are available online, but none of them had the possibility
to switch to a language other than English.

Try the teleprompter now at [m-ff-m.github.io/teleprompter](https://m-ff-m.github.io/teleprompter/).

## To Do

- Improve word matching: allow to skip words (in particular, if there is a single 100% match, the matching words should be aligned), probably always consider a longer run of words
- Testing in languages other than English
- Add moving microphone icon to make recording more visible
- Add timer
